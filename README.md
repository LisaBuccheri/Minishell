# Minishell
The aim of this project was to create a minimalist shell. We were a group of 3 student. 

Our shell had implement redirections, pipes, the following builtins:
  ◦ echo and the -n option
  ◦ cd only with a relative or absolute path
  ◦ pwd without any option
  ◦ export without any option
  ◦ unset with no options
  ◦ env with no options or arguments
  ◦ exit with no options
Manage environment variables, $?, ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\, which must function as in bash. 
We have learned more about processes and file descriptors.
